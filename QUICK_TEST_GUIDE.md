## 🔍 What to Check

### Admin Panel Queries

**Check Sweeps:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM wallet_sweeps 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

**Check Deposits:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM transactions 
WHERE transaction_type = 'deposit' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Check Balances:**
```sql
SELECT user_id, token, balance 
FROM wallet_balances 
WHERE balance > 0;
```

### After Deposit
```
✅ User wallet (blockchain): ~0 (swept to master)
✅ Master wallet (blockchain): [your deposit amount]
✅ User balance (database): [your deposit amount]
✅ Transaction record: type='deposit'
✅ Sweep record: status='completed'
```

### After Withdrawal
```
✅ Master wallet sent transaction
✅ User balance decremented
✅ Transaction record: type='external'
```

### After Internal Transfer
```
✅ No blockchain transaction
✅ Sender balance down
✅ Receiver balance up
✅ Transaction record: type='internal'
```

## ⚠️ Common Issues

### "No deposits detected"
- **Cause:** Transaction not confirmed yet
- **Fix:** Wait 1-2 minutes, try again

### "Sweep failed"
- **Cause:** Not enough gas in user wallet
- **Fix:** Send more native tokens (at least 0.05)

### "Balance not showing"
- **Cause:** Page not refreshed
- **Fix:** Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
