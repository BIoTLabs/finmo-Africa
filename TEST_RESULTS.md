## ✅ Code Review Results

### 1. `sweep-user-wallets` Function
**Fixed Issues:**
- ✅ **Balance Increment Logic** - Changed from SET to INCREMENT
  ```typescript
  // OLD (WRONG): balance: sweepAmountEth
  // NEW (CORRECT): balance: (currentBalance || 0) + sweepAmountEth
  ```
- ✅ **Transaction Record Creation** - Now creates deposit records
  ```typescript
  await supabase.from('transactions').insert({
    transaction_type: 'deposit',
    sender_wallet: 'external',
    // ... proper deposit record
  });
  ```
- ✅ **Sweep Record Creation** - Records in `wallet_sweeps` table
- ✅ **Supports Multiple Chains** - Polygon Amoy, Ethereum Sepolia
- ✅ **Gas Reserve Logic** - Reserves 0.01 native token for gas

**Status:** ✅ Correctly implemented

### 2. `detect-deposits` Function (NEW)
**Features:**
- ✅ Scans all user wallets for deposits
- ✅ Checks native tokens (MATIC, ETH)
- ✅ Checks USDC balances
- ✅ Minimum threshold: 0.01 to avoid dust
- ✅ Automatically triggers `sweep-user-wallets` when deposits found
- ✅ Returns detailed deposit information

**Status:** ✅ Correctly implemented

### 3. Auto-Sync Integration
**Hooks Updated:**
- ✅ `useAutoBalanceSync` - Calls detect-deposits every 2 minutes
- ✅ Dashboard - Manual sync button calls detect-deposits
- ✅ AddFunds page - Triggers detect-deposits after manual verification

**Status:** ✅ All integration points updated

### 4. Admin Panel
**New Features Added:**
- ✅ "Scan & Sweep Now" button for manual deposit detection
- ✅ "Initialize Wallets & Sweep" button (already existed)
- ✅ "Force Resync All" button (already existed)

**Status:** ✅ Admin controls properly configured

## 🔍 Current System State

### Users with Custodial Wallets
- **Total:** 6 users
- **With Private Keys:** 6 (100%)
- **Status:** ✅ All users ready for deposits

### Recent Transactions
```
Latest 5 transactions:
1. 10 USDC - external - 2025-10-25
2. 2.5 USDC - internal - 2025-10-16
3. 7 USDC - internal - 2025-10-14
4. 3 USDC - internal - 2025-10-13
5. 10 USDC - external - 2025-10-12
```
**Observation:** Only 'external' and 'internal' types visible (no 'deposit' yet - this is expected as no sweeps have run)

### Wallet Sweeps
- **Total Sweeps:** 0
- **Status:** No sweeps yet (expected - needs deposits to sweep)

### Wallet Balances
- **All balances:** 0
- **Status:** Expected - no deposits detected/swept yet

- [x] Code logic reviewed and fixed

### 🔄 Pending User Testing

#### Test 1: Deposit Detection (Manual)
**Steps:**
1. Go to Admin Panel
2. Click "Scan & Sweep Now" button
3. Observe result toast notification

**Expected Result:**
- If no deposits: "No deposits found"
- If deposits found: "Found and processed X deposits"

**Status:** ⏳ Ready for manual testing

#### Test 2: Real Deposit Flow
**Steps:**
1. Get a user's wallet address from Dashboard → Receive
2. Send testnet tokens from faucet:
   - Polygon Amoy MATIC: https://faucet.polygon.technology/
   - Ethereum Sepolia ETH: https://sepoliafaucet.com/
   - USDC: Use test USDC contracts
3. Wait 2 minutes OR click "Scan & Sweep Now"
4. Check Dashboard balance

**Expected Result:**
- User balance updates with deposited amount
- Transaction appears with type='deposit'
- wallet_sweeps table has record
- Master wallet receives funds

**Status:** ⏳ Ready for manual testing

#### Test 3: Withdrawal After Deposit
**Steps:**
1. Complete Test 2 (have balance)
2. Go to Send → External Address
3. Send to external address
4. Verify transaction completes

**Expected Result:**
- Balance decrements
- Transaction sent from master wallet
- Transaction recorded with type='external'

**Status:** ⏳ Ready for manual testing

#### Test 4: Internal Transfer
**Steps:**
1. Send from one FinMo user to another
2. Check both balances

**Expected Result:**
- Sender balance decrements
- Receiver balance increments  
- No blockchain transaction
- Transaction recorded with type='internal'

**Status:** ⏳ Ready for manual testing

## 🎯 Test Scenarios Summary

### Scenario 1: Fresh Deposit ⏳
```
User deposits → detect-deposits scans → sweep-user-wallets executes 
→ balance incremented → transaction recorded
```
**Result:** Waiting for real deposit to test

### Scenario 2: Multiple Deposits ⏳
```
Multiple users deposit → detect-deposits finds all → sweeps all wallets 
→ all balances updated → master wallet consolidated
```
**Result:** Waiting for real deposits to test

### Scenario 3: Deposit Then Withdraw ⏳
```
User deposits → sweep → balance updated → user withdraws 
→ master wallet sends → balance decremented
```
**Result:** Waiting for real deposit to test

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### 1. Function Authorization
**Issue:** `detect-deposits` returns 401 when called via curl without auth
**Impact:** Cannot test via direct API call without user session
**Workaround:** Test via Admin Panel button (has user auth)
**Status:** ⚠️ Expected behavior - function needs user auth from frontend

### 2. No Deposits Yet
**Issue:** No real deposits have been made to user wallets
**Impact:** Cannot verify sweep logic works end-to-end
**Workaround:** User needs to send testnet tokens to wallet address
**Status:** ⏳ Waiting for user to make test deposit

### 3. Testnet RPC Rate Limits
**Issue:** Public RPCs may rate limit if scanning too frequently
**Impact:** Detect-deposits may occasionally fail
**Workaround:** Use paid RPC providers for production
**Status:** ℹ️ Acceptable for testnet

## 📊 System Architecture Verification

### Deposit Flow ✅
```
